    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1> 
    <p>Last updated: February 07, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>Play RKT inc</strong> ("we," "us," or "our") built the <strong>Frame Grabber</strong> app as a Freemium app. This SERVICE is provided by Play RKT inc at no cost regarding the basic features, but includes advertisements and optional paid subscriptions.

        <li><strong>Write/Save Images:</strong> To save the extracted photo (frame) back to your device's gallery.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> The video processing is performed <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not upload your videos or your extracted photos to any external server. Your personal media remains private on your device.</p>

    <h3>B. Advertising and Analytics</h3>
